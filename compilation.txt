In order to compile this application you need the following packages:

libpcre
libmysqlclient
libevent
flex
bison

For example in Debian Oldstable you will need:
libpcre3
libpcre3-dev
libevent-dev

For Ubuntu I had to install:
libmysqlclient15-dev
libevent-dev

If you use default installation of FreeBSD you will need to run the following packages:

pkg_add -r bison
pkg_add -r libevent
pkg_add -r pcre
pkg_add -r mysql51-client
