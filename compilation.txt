In order to compile this application you need the following packages:

g++
libpcre
libmysqlclient
libevent
flex
bison

For Ubuntu and Debian I had to install:

libmysqlclient15-dev
libevent-dev
libpcre3-dev
libpcre3


For example in Debian Oldstable you will need:
libpcre3
libpcre3-dev
libevent1
libevent-dev
libmysqlclient14
libmysqlclient14-dev

In order to build deb package you will need the folowing:
sudo apt-get install devscripts
sudo apt-get install fakeroot
sudo apt-get install debhelper
sudo apt-get install build-essential


If you use default installation of FreeBSD you will need to install the following packages:

pkg_add -r bison
pkg_add -r libevent
pkg_add -r pcre
pkg_add -r mysql51-client
